/**
 * The read side of the password settings: what the policy IS right now, for the attempt about to
 * be judged. The mirror of {@link MinPasswordLengthStore}, which is the write side — and
 * deliberately a separate port, because the two answer different questions: the store lays a value
 * on one rung, while this reports the winner of the whole ladder. Write 3 through the store and
 * this may still answer 5, because the ladder refused the row and fell through; on one interface
 * that would read as a bug rather than as the design.
 *
 * A use case holds this port, not a policy: it outlives any single value, so it must ask per
 * attempt — an administrator's decision has to be honoured by the next request, without a restart.
 * What stands behind it belongs to the implementation; a use case only ever learns the answer.
